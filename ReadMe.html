Background
The game we know as poker is believed to have ancient roots that go back nearly 1,000 years, crossing several continents and cultures. Some historians say poker’s origins can be traced to a domino-card game played by a 10th-century Chinese emperor; others claim it is a descendant of the Persian card game “As Nas,” which dates to the 16th century. Poker’s closest European predecessor was Poque, which caught on in France in the 17th century. Poque and its German equivalent, pochen, were both based on the 16th-century Spanish game primero, which featured three cards dealt to each player and bluffing (or betting high on poor cards) as a key part of the game. French colonists brought Poque to their settlements in North America, including New Orleans and the surrounding area, which became part of the United States thanks to the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. English-speaking settlers in the region Anglicized Poque to poker and adopted features of the modern game, including five cards for each player and (by 1834) a 52-card deck.
From there, poker spread up the Mississippi River and throughout the country, thanks in part to its popularity among crews of riverboats transporting goods via that great waterway. Soldiers in both the North and South played poker during the Civil War, and it became a staple of Wild West saloons in frontier settlements in the 1870s and 1880s. In 1871 the game was introduced to Europe after Queen Victoria heard the U.S. minister to Great Britain explaining the game to members of her court and asked him for the rules. More general acceptance of poker in Europe occurred several decades later, largely thanks to the influence of American soldiers during World War I. Over time, different games have dominated among poker players, including five-card draw, seven-card stud and—most recently—Texas Hold’em, which began its rise to dominance in the 1970s when it became the featured game in the World Series of Poker, the game’s leading annual competition.

How to Play
There several variants to the game.  For the purpose of this exercise, the game is played as such:
5 Cards each, referred to as a hand, are dealt to each player
The highest / strongest hand is determined to be the winner
The Tie Breaker rules (below) are used to determine the winner in the event of hands of equal strength
Poker Hands



Tie Breaker Rules


Ranking
Rank-card(s)
Kicker-card(s)
Tie Breakers
ROYAL FLUSH
Royal Flush Cards
NA
An Ace-High Straight Flush Is Called Royal Flush. A Royal Flush Is the Highest Hand in Poker. Between Two Royal Flushes, There Can Be No Tie Breaker. If Two Players Have Royal Flushes, They Split the Pot. 
STRAIGHT FLUSH
Top Card
NA
Straight Flushes Come in Varying Strengths from Five High to A King High. A King High Straight Flush Loses Only to A Royal. If More Than One Player Has A Straight Flush, The Winner Is the Player with The Highest Card Used in The Straight. A Queen High Straight Flush Beats A Jack High and A Jack High Beats A Ten High and So On. The Suit Never Comes into Play I.E. A Seven High Straight Flush of Diamonds Will Split The Pot With A Seven High Straight Flush Of Hearts.
FOUR OF A KIND
Four of A Kind Card
Remaining 1
This One Is Simple. Four Aces Beats Any Other Four of a Kind, Four Kings Beats Four Queens or Less and So On.  The tie breaker is the highest remaining card in the hand.  
FULL HOUSE
Trips & Pair Card
NA
When Two Or More Players Have Full Houses, We Look First at The Strength of The Three of a Kind to Determine the Winner. For Example, Aces Full of Deuces (AAA22) Beats Kings Full of Jacks (KKKJJ). 
FLUSH
Flush Cards
NA
A Flush Is Any Hand with Five Cards of The Same Suit. If Two Or More Players Hold A Flush, The Flush with The Highest Card Wins. If More Than One Player Has the Same Strength High Card, Then the Strength of The Second Highest Card Held Wins. This Continues Through the Five Highest Cards in The Player's Hands.
STRAIGHT
Top Card
NA
A Straight Is Any Five Cards in Sequence, But Not Necessarily of The Same Suit. If More Than One Player Has A Straight, The Straight Ending in The Card Wins. If Both Straights End in A Card of The Same Strength, The Hand Is Tied.
THREE OF A KIND
Trips Card
Remaining 2
If More Than One Player Holds Three of a Kind, Then the Higher Value of The Cards Used to Make the Three of a Kind Determines the Winner. If Two Or More Players Have the Same Three of a Kind, Then A Fourth Card (And A Fifth If Necessary) Can Be Used as Kickers to Determine the Winner.
TWO PAIR
1st & 2nd Pair Card
Remaining 1
The Highest Pair Is Used to Determine the Winner. If Two Or More Players Have the Same Highest Pair, Then the Highest of The Second Pair Determines the Winner. If Both Players Hold Identical Two Pairs, The Fifth Card Is Used to Break the Tie.
ONE PAIR
Pair Card
Remaining 3
If Two Or More Players Hold A Single Pair, Then Highest Pair Wins. If the Pairs Are of The Same Value, The Highest Kicker Card Determines the Winner. A Second and Even Third Kicker Can Be Used If Necessary.
HIGH CARD
Top Card
Remaining 4
When No Player Has Even A Pair, Then the Highest Card Wins. When Both Players Have Identical High Cards, The Next Highest Card Wins, And So on Until Five Cards Have Been Used. In the Unusual Circumstance That Two Players Hold the Identical Five Cards, The Pot Would Be Split.




System Requirements
Functional Requirements
The application to be built will be a console application that will determine the winning hand of poker.  Running the application, a user will be prompted to enter in the “hands” for two players.  Each hand consists of 5 cards.  The cards will be represented by two characters (i.e. 2C is the 2 of Clubs).  
Input to the system will consist of a string of 10 cards, the first 5 cards will represent the left hand and the remaining 5 cards will represent the right hand.  
For example, given the input of:  2H 5D JC AS 5H 4H QS 9S JD KH
Would translate to the left hand having:  2H 5D JC AS 5H 
2 of Hearts
5 of Diamonds
Jack of Clubs
Ace of Spades
5 of Hearts
And the Right hand having:  4H QS 9S JD KH
4 of Hearts
Queen of Spades
9 of Spades
Jack of Diamonds
King of Hearts
The application will read the input of hands and determine the winner or draw by outputting one of the following:
Left Hand Wins
Right Hand Wins
Draw
Acceptance Criteria
Determining the Winner
Given:  Left and Right hands represented by System Cards as the input to the system
Then:  The system should output the correct winner according to the Tie Breaker Rules table

Determining a draw
Given:  Left and Right hands represented by System Cards as the input to the system
When:  Both hands result in a draw
Then:  The system should output “Draw”

Non-Functional Requirements
The source code should include a Readme.md file that can be displayed on Github.  
This file should contain all instructions on how to start the application, how pass input to the application and what to expect for results.  
This file should contain a section explains the solution approach so that another developer can modify or extend the application (i.e. explain how the application was put together)
The application should adhere to SOLID design principles.  
The application should be testable and extendable.  For example, we may want to introduce a Texas Hold’em way to play the game
The application should verify the input are valid cards and hands.  
The application should be written as either a .NET Framework console application or Dotnet Core console application. 
Tips and Advice
This is a challenging project.  It requires analysis of a domain, translation to system requirements and code and finally implementing a well-constructed application that adheres to good programing practices.  
Is your application testable?
What type of algorithms are you planning to use to solve the multiple challenges presented here?
Don’t skimp on the documentation.  You will be working on a team.  Writing code is just one part of the job – you also need to write documentation for other team members and clients.  Your documentation should explain how to use your app, how to fix / extend it, etc.  
Remember the technical phone screen?  Think about what we were asking about and how that would apply to your application.
